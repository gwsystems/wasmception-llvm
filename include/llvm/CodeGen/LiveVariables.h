//
// This file implements the LiveVariables analysis pass.  For each machine
// instruction in the function, this pass calculates the set of registers that
// are immediately dead after the instruction (i.e., the instruction calculates
// the value, but it is never used) and the set of registers that are used by
// the instruction, but are never used after the instruction (i.e., they are
// killed).
//
// This class computes live variables using a sparse implementation based on
// the machine code SSA form.  This class computes live variable information for
// each virtual and _register allocatable_ physical register in a function.  It
// uses the dominance properties of SSA form to efficiently compute live
// variables for virtual registers, and assumes that physical registers are only
// live within a single basic block (allowing it to do a single local analysis
// to resolve physical register lifetimes in each basic block).  If a physical
// register is not register allocatable, it is not tracked.  This is useful for
// things like the stack pointer and condition codes.

  /// VarInfo - This represents the regions where a virtual register is live in
  /// the program.  We represent this with three different pieces of
  /// information: the instruction that uniquely defines the value, the set of
  /// blocks the instruction is live into and live out of, and the set of 
  /// non-phi instructions that are the last users of the value.
  ///
  /// In the common case where a value is defined and killed in the same block,
  /// There is one killing instruction, and  AliveBlocks is empty.
  ///
  /// Otherwise, the value is live out of the block.  If the value is live
  /// across any blocks, these blocks are listed in AliveBlocks.  Blocks where
  /// the liveness range ends are not included in AliveBlocks, instead being
  /// captured by the Kills set.  In these blocks, the value is live into the
  /// block (unless the value is defined and killed in the same block) and lives
  /// until the specified instruction.  Note that there cannot ever be a value
  /// whose Kills set contains two instructions from the same basic block.
  ///
  /// PHI nodes complicate things a bit.  If a PHI node is the last user of a
  /// value in one of its predecessor blocks, it is not listed in the kills set,
  /// but does include the predecessor block in the AliveBlocks set (unless that
  /// block also defines the value).  This leads to the (perfectly sensical)
  /// situation where a value is defined in a block, and the last use is a phi
  /// node in the successor.  In this case, AliveBlocks is empty (the value is
  /// not live across any  blocks) and Kills is empty (phi nodes are not
  /// included). This is sensical because the value must be live to the end of
  /// the block, but is not live in any successor blocks.
